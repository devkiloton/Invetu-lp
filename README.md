It's a simple landing page built with Nextjs that gives access to the <a href="https://app.invetu.com">Invetu's web app</a> and show some features that are/will be implement in the app. Besides present information to the user, the web site has a section to collect feedbacks and suggestions from the user. Other than that is the possibility of the user subscribe to the newsletter in the home to stay updated.

## Why Nextjs for a simple landing page?
It might seems to be unnecessary in a first sight, because a landing page in many cases is created with no-code solutions such as Wix, Webflow, GoDaddy, etc. But these tools "fail" in 2 things: SEO, performance and some times accessibility. Their SEO and performance might be good, but when compared with the landing page that I have coded, there's no comparison and the Google Lighthouse shows that.

Having that in mind, I decided it would be a better experience to my users.
